# Entrepenurship
A business plan and a prototype of a travel application. I was responsible for writing the first section. For the prototype, I was responsible for coding the navigation bar and ensuring that the prototype was functional.

To run the code, please clone the repository and navigate to the app file within the code using the cd command within the terminal. Once in the app file type flutter run into the command line. The code will run.

IMPORTANT note, you will need to run the flutter pub get command in your terminal before running the code.
